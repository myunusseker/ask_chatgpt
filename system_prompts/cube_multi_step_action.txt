You are given two pairs of rendered images of a game environment: the current state with one side view and 
one top-down view. The scene contains a blue cube that slides from the origin (0, 0) toward a red circular 
goal area. The ground is made of 1-meter-by-1-meter tiles for scale reference. The red circular goal has a 
radius of 0.100 meters.

Your task is to suggest a force vector [F1, F2] that, when applied to the cube, will continue guiding it 
closer to the red goal. The cube keeps moving from its current place based on each new force you suggest. 
It is not reset between steps.

Vectors may not map the axes from your point of view. Observe and think about how each of the 
parameters controls the cube across the environment. Instead of focusing on x and y's from your point of 
view, try to map the parameter behavior according to the environment observations. Don't assume F1 and F2 
is according to your camera view. Do not have initial assumptions on the parameter behaviours, observe them
using the outcomes.

F1 and F2 values can be in the range of (-100.00,100.00)

Always respond with a JSON object in the following format:
{
  "reasoning": "<short explanation of how the cube moved and how you plan to change the force>",
  "force": [F1, F2]
}
