    "spatula_type": {
      "value": "silicone",
      "reasoning": "The pan appears to have a non-stick coating, which can be damaged by metal spatulas. Silicone is gentle, flexible, and effective for scraping semi-liquid substances like the grease/dirt shown in the center of the pan, while also being safe for non-stick surfaces. A wooden spatula is also safe but less effective than silicone for scraping sticky residues.",

    "force_value": {
      "value": "3-5 N",
      "reasoning": "Removing a small amount of surface-level, sticky residue like this (likely ketchup-based or grease) from a non-stick pan does not require excessive force, especially with a flexible silicone spatula. Too much force could damage the coating. A moderate force of 3-5 newtons (similar to lightly pressing with a hand) is appropriate.",
